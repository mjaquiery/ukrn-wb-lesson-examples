> > ## Ideas
> > Some reasons that are commonly cited are:
> > - If I share my data, people might find mistakes in it, and that would be embarrassing
> > - My data are probably too sensitive to share -- they're private or personal
> > - It takes time to learn how to share and do the sharing -- time I don't have
> > - I don't want to maintain my data, and I'd feel obliged to if I shared it
> > - My data wouldn't be of any use to anyone
> > - People could use my data for purposes I don't agree with
> > - I worked hard to collect these data and I don't want other people to benefit from my work

> ## Your experiences `10 min`
> Now we have listed some benefits and concerns of sharing, go around your small group and have
> each group member identify two items that they have experience with.
> You can choose a benefit and a concern, or two benefits or even two concerns.
> For each one, share your experience of it with your colleagues.
> If you have time, add a brief note about your experience to the
> <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>,
> but the focus should be on sharing with your colleagues and listening to what they have to say.

> ## Addressing concerns `10 min`
> We have a list of concerns that people in your workshops might have.
> It's helpful to be able to provide some perspective on those concerns --
> we want to acknowledge that sharing can be frightening or difficult,
> but highlight that it is worth doing anyway!
>
> Again, in your group, choose two of the concerns. If they are concerns you have
> or have had yourself, that's ideal, but they could also be ones that you just
> find interesting.
> Go around the group, discussing each person's concerns.
> Try to think of reasons why the concern should not hold you back from
> sharing your data.
> If you can't think of anything, try asking the larger group or one of the
> workshop instructors or helpers.
>
> Remember, it's not wrong to have concerns! We believe that sharing data
> is important and that the benefits outweigh the concerns, and we'd like to help
> you understand why and give you any encouragement you need.
