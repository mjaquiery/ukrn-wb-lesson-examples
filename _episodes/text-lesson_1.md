## What is the OSF?

The OSF ([https://osf.io/](https://osf.io/)) is an online collaboration and project management platform for research projects. 
The OSF is built and supported by the Center for Open Science ([https://cos.io/](https://cos.io/)), a non-profit organisation for increasing the openness, integrity, and reproducibility of research.

The OSF platform allows researchers to organise projects, store data, create registrations, and publish preprints. 
Projects can be subdivided into components, for which public and private sharing, collaborations, licensing, and DOIs can be individually managed.

## What can the OSF do for me?

The key capabilities of the OSF which matter to most researchers are project management, data storage, and collaboration.
The aim of the OSF is to be useful enough _to working researchers_ that the sharing and registration features are simply useful additions.
