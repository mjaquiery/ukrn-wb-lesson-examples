## What is a license?

Roughly, in lay terms, when you put in work to create or curate something, you acquire _rights_ over that thing. 
Your rights include things like the right to be identified as the author.
When other people use your work, they may do things that infringe upon your rights. 
To help them understand what they can and can't do, and to give them a legal basis on which to interact with your work, you can apply a _waiver_ or a _license_ to your work.

* A _waiver_ gives up rights, meaning that those rights cannot be infringed. 
* A _license_ specifies how someone can use your work. 
	* Generally, this adds to what people can do
	* But it can also require them to do some things, such as credit you as the author

If you don't include a waiver or a license people will not know how they can legally and appropriately use your work.
**Include a license**.

## How do I choose a license?

* Licenses used by others in your field
* Funder/Institution/Government requirements/guidance
* [License picker tool](http://ufal.github.io/public-license-selector/)

## What common data licenses are there to choose?

There are several _families of licenses_ which offer suites of similar licenses that place different restrictions on the users.
The families covered here are _Creative Commons_, _Open Data Commons_, and _(UK) Government License_.
Each subheading below addresses a different use case.

### Public domain

To make your data maximally reusable, at the cost of losing the (legal) right to attribution and any control over how it is used, apply a public domain license. 
Public domain licenses can consist of a waiver, giving up all your rights, and a permissive license in case the waiver is not acceptable.
These licenses avoid the _attribution stacking_ problem of attribution licenses, but can only be used where 

* CC0 4.0
* **PDDL**: Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License
	* The PDDL includes attribution-sharealike requests as community norms, but not as legal requirements

> ## Community norms
> Just because you're legally _allowed_ to do something, doesn't mean you should.
> It's within the license terms of a public domain release to include a work verbatim without attribution, but many communities have strong norms against plagarism.
> 
> If the norms of your community cover your concerns, and you're not especially worries about how your work is used outside your community, you can use a public domain license even if you would _like_ attribution (you just don't _require_ it).
