teaching: 10
exercises: 20
duration: null
summary: In this lesson we will collaboratively build a checklist to help us in
  anonymising quantitative data so that it can be shared. We will consider how
  these steps can be done automatically.
questions:
  - Why do we need to anonymize data?
  - How do we anonymize data?
objectives:
  - Gain an understanding of how to anonymise data
  - Create a checklist of anonymisation steps for quantitative data
keypoints:
  - Anonymised data are easier to share legally.
  - Remove direct identifiers
  - Reduce precision to stop outliers leading to identification
  - Consider the potential for cross-identification
